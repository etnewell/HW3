# HW3

#I was tasked with creating a pseudorandom password generator from 8 to 124 characters.
#The largest challenge I tended to have was to get my loops to work, however it turns out it wasn't only my loops and thier logic bounds but also my 'math.random' wasn't capitalized like 'Math.random'.
#It is an imporant thing to have long character passwords for secure things with multiple different types of characters, so this tool is useful to anyone that needs a password.


#Features
    #The ability to specify length of password
    #The ability to specify whether or not you want special characters, capital letters, lowercase letters, or numbers

#I had a good challenge doing this and it helped me gain more familiarity with loops.
